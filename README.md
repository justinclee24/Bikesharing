## Summary
Although women do utilize this bikesharing business a significant amount, the way men trump usage suggests that the concept should be marketed toward rather active male professionals who need a fast and flexible way to get to work as well as use leisurely. Maintenance hours should be around 2-4am while bike availability should be optimized at close to 5-6pm. Subscribers tend to utilize the app much more often, especially males, so convincing people to subscribe to our service should be high priority. Given the current dataset, two additional visualizations that can be performed in the future would be to compare and contrast the relationship between usertype and birth year as well as gender (most likely with a density chart). Also, throughout the module, bike maintenance was a key topic, so gaining more insight into the utilization of bikes by bikeid through visualization such as a packed bubble graph would be useful.
